Message_0_Page_0 I am a captain of the forces that remain, led by the Governor Eduard. I came here attempting to find out, what happened to our scouts.
Message_0_Page_1 I found this place, and seeing that some terrible thing has happened here, I dug this pit in the snow to hide myself whilst I search the area. 
Message_0_Page_2 I fear that our scouts did not make it this far north, but there are the bones of men here, and I must know for sure, before I move on. I shall go south after, towards the research center.
