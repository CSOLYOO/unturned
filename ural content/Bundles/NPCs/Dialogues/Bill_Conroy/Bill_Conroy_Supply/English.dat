Message_0_Page_0 My name is Bill, the sick guy behind me is my trucking partner, Paul. We came through this land, hauling goods, just before the outbreak. Things went "south" shortly after, and we found this village.
Message_0_Page_1 We fought hard with the undead, and managed to block ourselves in here, but Paul took a nasty hit. I fear he is lost, for he is already talking nonsense, or at least thats all I can make of it! 
Message_0_Page_2 I might have a few things left from the truck, if you want to trade.
