Message_0_Page_0 Awwww! My wounds ache so bad... I am the Third member of a special scout team... S.S. Scout Ceta.
Message_0_Page_1 I found Special Scout Delta dead some ways north of here, where there was also a survivor that informed me of Scout Deltas demise; "I arrived in time only to hear him say something about Strange lights at the research center, I do not know what killed him".
Message_0_Page_2 So I came here, to uncover what Delta had found, but I have sustained some heavy injuries. I will try to hold out here until my commander sends help. Please, search for the other 3 S.S. team members, they may still be alive!
