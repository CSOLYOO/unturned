Message_0_Page_0 I am part of a team of US spies sent here before the outbreak, and after finding strange radiation readings in this area, I found this cave. These carvings in the rock suggest that this place is very old.
Message_0_Page_1 I will stay here for a while to do some carbon tests and make notes about my findings, as my team mate still lives, and wants answers to this mystery as much as I do. I will head further into the cave after.
Message_0_Page_2 There is something strange presence in this place. I have heard noises from the passageway beyond, and seen bears in the caves behind us, if you go further in, I would suggest you be very careful!
