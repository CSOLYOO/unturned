Message_0_Page_0 We are one of the last surviving groups we know of in this region. You are welcome to stay here a while, we will do what we can to help. We have established trading with other individuals, you can buy things from me or the Doctor.
Message_0_Page_1 Although I know it might mean great danger, I would ask that you go to "Plum Farm", a ways east of here. One of our scavengers ran into trouble there, and is holed up somewhere. His last report just tells of his radio going dead and that his leg is broken.
Message_0_Page_2 Do what you can to keep him alive until I can spare more men to return him here. Be warned though, there are likely undead there, and that report also mentioned him seeing a large, white-haired beast up in the snow.
