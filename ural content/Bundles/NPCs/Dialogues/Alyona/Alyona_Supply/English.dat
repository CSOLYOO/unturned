Message_0_Page_0 I was on holiday when the outbreak started and all the public transport stopped. I have been surviving here since, by scavenging what I can from the region, and trading it with the survivors at the Harbour. 
Message_0_Page_1 Some military forces showed up here a while ago, but the infected swarmed them. I think some of them tried to get away by entering the tombs, but I am pretty sure there are even more infected down there.
Message_0_Page_2 Let me know if want to trade!
