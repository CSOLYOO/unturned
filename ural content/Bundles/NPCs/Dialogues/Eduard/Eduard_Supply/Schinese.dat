Message_0_Page_0 As ex-Governor of this Oblast, I am the highest ranking remaining officer since the outbreak. This makes me the current head of state, as the rest are dead, or turned. Since our new "reform", my forces have found out that there are plenty of secrets and mysteries here.
Message_0_Page_1 My men are informing me of "ghosts", strange blue lights, and it seems some of the undead are "mutating" into even stronger forms! IÂ´m not sure whats going on, but maybe you can find some clues. I have sent a scout team east, on a mission to help us survive.
Message_0_Page_2 We have not heard from any of them for a long time now, and I fear the worst. Perhaps if you explore that part of the mountains, you would search for them? Oh, and you might want to check out the hotel across the street, it used to be our cache, but we lost it to the undead.
