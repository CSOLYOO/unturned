Message_0_Page_0 A fisherman and diver by trade, I came to these waters after the outbreak, hoping to find some place of safety, and perhaps with cleaner waters.
Message_0_Page_1 We found this wreck, and I have since come to realise it was bound for the Harbour, and judging from the crates IÂ´ve uncovered around it, was bringing troops and gear to aid the Governor.
Message_0_Page_2 I need some supplies to keep working down here. I will trade you for them, in exchange for some of the gear I uncover.
