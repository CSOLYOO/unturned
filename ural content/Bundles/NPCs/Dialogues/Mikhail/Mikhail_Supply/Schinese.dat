Message_0_Page_0 After the outbreak, I fled from my home town, Bayanovka, to this old Monastery. And although the undead walk these halls, I have managed so far, to stay alive. And I still believe, we can rebuild some form of society.
Message_0_Page_1 I have been gathering the coins and notes, used in the monetary system, before the outbreak, and I am willing to trade them with you. I scavenge what items I can find, I can also offer you some of them.
