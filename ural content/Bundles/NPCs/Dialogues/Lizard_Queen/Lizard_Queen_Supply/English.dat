Message_0_Page_0 Do you, mortal, not realise the importance of that which lies underground? Mankind is blasting and digging holes, endlessly seeking more "ore", as you call it, and removing it from the mountains.
Message_0_Page_1 They do not understand, that it is an essential to the well-being of all living things here, including themselves? I will test your will, and count the yellow, Red, Green, Blue and Purple "ores", that you claim!
