Message_0_Page_0 I used to run a games store in the U.S. and came here with my employees just before the outbreak, as a holiday. We found this mine and now we labour hard to provide what is left of humanity with essential ores.
Message_0_Page_1 You are welcome to mine here. Did you know that this is just one of countless mines in the region? Or that a vast array of ore and mineral types are present?
Message_0_Page_2 I am willing to trade if you have ores or minerals, are experienced enough, or if you have something we need.
