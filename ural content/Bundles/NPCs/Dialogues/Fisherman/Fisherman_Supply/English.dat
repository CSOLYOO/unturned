Message_0_Page_0 I love fishing, and after the outbreak, it has turned out to be a very practical thing to be doing, what with the lack of food, and everyone off their rocker and all.
Message_0_Page_1 This little inlet is teeming with fish, I have caught quite a few already. Im willing to trade if you are interested.
Message_0_Page_2 Now if I can just locate that big squid I know lives somewhere around here, it will be a mighty catch!
