Message_0_Page_0 I was scavenging on this farm for supplies when I spotted some huge, white-haired beast on the snowy hill to the north east, I panicked, ran into the plantation and got overwhelmed by the undead.
Message_0_Page_1 My radio is damaged and one of the zombies got a big hit in on my leg, which is now broken. I also dont feel good at all... I am safe in here for now, but I could use some medicine until Red turns up to rescue me.
Message_0_Page_2 Maybe you would bring me some? Just be careful, the undead are close by, not to mention what ever that was I saw on the hill. I will lay here and rest until you return.
