Interactability_Text_Line_2 Dear Diary, last night, me and Rod were stationed on the bridge watching harbour.
Interactability_Text_Line_3 We had been getting reports of Noobs looting harbour and wanted some target practice.
Interactability_Text_Line_4 Unfortunatly, we may have gotten distracted... just a little... Rod died. Wasn't me... The boss won't be happy.
