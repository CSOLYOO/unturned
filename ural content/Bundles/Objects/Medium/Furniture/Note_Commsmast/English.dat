Name Note - Commsmast

Interactability_Text_Line_0 Day 1 after the crash: My wound from the crash is pretty bad, but I am lucky to be alive, the others died when our aircraft hit the mast. Will try to get hold of HQ on the radio tomorrow. 
Interactability_Text_Line_1 Day 2 Radio is ruined, so I cannot contact HQ. Might be able to establish a new connection from this mast, although so far all I get is some short-wave music.
Interactability_Text_Line_2 Day 3 Managed to salvage some food from a cottage nearby. Saw some people down on the track below the mast. Heard some horrible growling from the north-east.
Interactability_Text_Line_3 Day 4 Went down to the cottage and found 2 survivors. One had been scratched, the other bitten, and they merely had bandages on their wounds. I told them a bandage wont stop it happening, that they will both turn soon.
Interactability_Text_Line_4 Day 5 Found food, water and a friendly survivor at the Monastery, returned to find both the survivors at the cottage had turned. They attacked me as I neared the cottage. Killed one but the other bit me on the arm.
Interactability_Text_Line_5 Not sure how much longer I will last, seen what happens to the infected. Tell my wife I love her. Kaptajn of Red first rank, Jasha.
