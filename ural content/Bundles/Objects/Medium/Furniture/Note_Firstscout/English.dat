Name Note - Firstscout

Interactability_Text_Line_0 Email title: S.S. Scout Alpha reporting.
Interactability_Text_Line_1 ---
Interactability_Text_Line_2 After getting seperated from the others in a blizzard, I found Scout Beta, or his remains, in this cottage south of where we were heading.
Interactability_Text_Line_3 I took a note from him, saying Scout Ceta had made it to the URC, but our orders were to go east, then north. Why did Scout Ceta go there?
Interactability_Text_Line_4 I have found deposits of Oh-91, and I saw some white-haired creature off in the snow last night. 
Interactability_Text_Line_5 I shall attempt to locate the other scouts, and failing that, I will head north to the cave mentioned in the last report. But I still wonder why Ceta went south, what did he find?
