Interactability_Text_Line_0 URC Labs communications readout - Classified Internal data. Lab Supervisor Peter reporting. 
Interactability_Text_Line_1 Initial tests on the radioactive ore/mineral we recieved from H.Q. have shown the most unexpected results. The compound seems to not only be emitting some strong form of radiation, but we have also detected chemical changes, some of which happen quickly. The first one took about a minute to complete.
Interactability_Text_Line_2 We have the sample contained in the shielded chamber, but somehow we are getting strong radiation readings OUTSIDE the chamber, too. Requesting orders on how to continue. Many of the Lab technicians are uneasy about the situation. I am trying to calm them, but many of them are "scared out of their wits" about something, and itÂ´s not just the radiation.
Interactability_Text_Line_3 I am requesting that you send us more military guards, as well as medical units and high-caliber weapons, as it might make my team more comfortable, if we are to go on testing this strange sample.
Interactability_Text_Line_4 One of the lab technicians went crazy and opened the shielded chamber! We heard deep rumbling and saw lights flashing in the chamber, so Yuri rushed in and trapped whatever it was by closing the chamber door. We managed to seal the bottom floor off but have all taken a lot of radiation, I fear we will die, or turn, soon.
Interactability_Text_Line_5 I found Yuri staring at the wall only to realise he had "turned". Had to put him down. I am on my last breath. I wish we had never started testing that sample...
