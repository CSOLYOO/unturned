Name Note - Stephan

Interactability_Text_Line_0 You offered me your love, yet I did not know what you were. I knew I would be flogged for telling my bailiff to get out of the mines.
Interactability_Text_Line_1 Yet when your radiating light came and saved me at the mine, I saw that it was your face, and I realised.
Interactability_Text_Line_2 You took me to the depths and wanted my proposal, yet I was truthful and told you my heart was promised to Nastyona.
Interactability_Text_Line_3 The riches you gave her have lasted us long, and are still kept in that place, for I could not forget about you.
Interactability_Text_Line_4 It overcame me, and I wandered, calling for you but did not find you. Now I have no love, and lie here, I am tired...
Interactability_Text_Line_5 It was a chancy thing to meet you, Mistress, it brings woe for a bad man, and for a good one there's little joy comes of it. Stephan
