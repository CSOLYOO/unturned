Interactability_Text_Line_0 Report for the Governor. Current state of affairs.
Interactability_Text_Line_1 ---
Interactability_Text_Line_2 Our remaining mobile forces have moved to the east as commanded, but after finding the Research Center irradiated and over-run by undead, we are searching the region to locate any supplies we can.
Interactability_Text_Line_3 Our scouts in the east and south report finding survivors, resources and caves, but we have lost contact with many of them in the last few weeks. We will try to locate them as soon as possible.
Interactability_Text_Line_4 We are encountering more mutations and strange creatures, we were attacked by giant spiders again yesterday. The strange "lightning-ball" or "anomaly" we saw two days ago, has not been seen since.
Interactability_Text_Line_5 We will continue to send reports. I hope we can return to Severouralsk soon with good news and more supplies. May god show his mercy on us in these times.
