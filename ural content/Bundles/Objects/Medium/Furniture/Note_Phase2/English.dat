Name Note - Phase2

Interactability_Text_Line_0 Chief Engineer Yuri reporting. Sir! We have found another cave in the easternmost regions, seemingly filled with OH91!
Interactability_Text_Line_1 We started mining, but after a few hours, horrible creatures came as if from nowhere, out of the very rocks around us. My men tried to flee.
Interactability_Text_Line_2 Many were lost this day, as the creatures overcame them, as the rest of us fled for our lives. Those of us that made it out alive are shaken to our bones, and now, many are refusing to go back.
Interactability_Text_Line_3 I am lost for words, the ore glows so bright, and we know the importance, it holds, in the research and development of the weapon. I only hope my men can find the courage to press on with the work!
Interactability_Text_Line_4 We will re-enter the cave, and do our best to ensure that enough of the ore is collected, but I have my doubts as to the courage of those left alive, faced with such horrors.
Interactability_Text_Line_5 I do not know if we will even make it out of this cave again with our lives. Our radios stopped working, and I am writing this report by hand, hoping to send it by messenger, back to you.
