Interactability_Text_Line_0 Calling all survivors!
Interactability_Text_Line_1 ---
Interactability_Text_Line_2 There is still hope! Come and meet us so we can build a friendship. We have food, drink and other supplies for trade, and we keep the areas around us safe from the undead.
Interactability_Text_Line_3 You will find myself in the top floor of the Severouralsk Police station, Red Maxim and his gang hold the survivor camp at the end of the Harbour. Alyona is at Irbit Cathedral.
Interactability_Text_Line_4 These are but a few of the people you may meet on your travels here. We look forward to trading with you, it is one of the few things we have left in these hard times.
Interactability_Text_Line_5 Commanding officer Governor Eduard.
