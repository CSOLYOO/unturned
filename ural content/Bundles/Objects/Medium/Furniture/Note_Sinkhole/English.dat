Interactability_Text_Line_0 Denezhkin Kamen Reserve Mining Report #3
Interactability_Text_Line_1 Chief Vladimir.
Interactability_Text_Line_2 We are setting up supports on the rocks above the platform to avoid landslides as we continue digging down.
Interactability_Text_Line_3 The conditions are sub-optimal and the lower levels are highly unsafe. We have not been provided enough materials to properly secure the lower tunnels, and the deadline is far too strict. 
Interactability_Text_Line_4 We will have a casualty or maybe more in the prospecting drift if we continue digging. Already two miners have been injured and will be recovering in Bayanovka for 1 month and 2 months respectively.
Interactability_Text_Line_5 My requests for additional time and/or resources to ensure our safety has been rejected twice. This OH91 is taking priority over the lives of hand-working Russians.
Interactability_Text_Line_6 A number of my men are beginning to feel ill also, especially those who have been exposed to the ore directly; delirium and anxiety are preventing them from continuing work. I recommend this mission be cancelled ASAP.
