Interactability_Text_Line_0 My dear Azovka
Interactability_Text_Line_1 Each day i long for you, your voice. Oh, your sweet, soothing voice, unmatched in its beauty. Like the gentle flow of the river, and the great thunder in the night.
Interactability_Text_Line_2 You abandonded me, left me to die in the snow. The memory of you, your name, your voice, fading from me helplessly. Now i am left here, bitter and alone, without you.
Interactability_Text_Line_3 Now? In our time of need, with the blue eagle drawing near from across the seas, and the dead rising from their graves! Now you choose to abandon me?
Interactability_Text_Line_4 Can't you see we are perfect together, a single being, inseparable? As the hammer and the sickle are, unified. Believe these words, for i know you are watching: I will find you, and take what you have stolen from me. With time you will reconsider leaving me, and we will be one again... and any man that tries to stand between you and i shall be cut down.
Interactability_Text_Line_5 Kirill "The Sickle"... Yes, that fits nicely...
