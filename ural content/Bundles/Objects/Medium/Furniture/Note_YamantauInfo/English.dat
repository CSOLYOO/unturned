Interactability_Text_Line_0 Brief history of the Yamantau region.
Interactability_Text_Line_1 Tallest of the peaks amoung the Northeastern Urals, Yamantau remains one of the most storied, yet elusive mountains of the range.
Interactability_Text_Line_2 Yamantau is a Bashkir name, which translates approximately to "Mountain of Evil." Countless tales have Arisen from this region, some akin to the tales of other nearby cultures, suggesting a common folkloric ancestor, others entirely unique amoung the lore of the Urals.
Interactability_Text_Line_3 The legends of Yeti carry through of course, from other regions of the Urals, as well as countless modern fantasies of UFO and unexplained radioactivity. Of course, very few of these reports have any actual evidence beyond witness reports backing them up, so their validity is uncertain.
Interactability_Text_Line_4 What is known however, is that there have been over 150 disappearances in the region in the past 80 years alone.
Interactability_Text_Line_5 If you should decide to venture there yourself, you probably wont find much, but maybe, just maybe, something really is waiting for you out there, in the cold, unforgiving landscape... Waiting for you to uncover it...
