Name Note - Overandout

Interactability_Text_Line_0 Special Scout Delta reporting. Im hoping somebody finds this, and perhaps even takes it on them to finish my mission for me.
Interactability_Text_Line_1 ---
Interactability_Text_Line_2 I was part of a scout team sent east, to locate survivors and resources. Eveything was going to plan, until a heavy blizzard split the group up.
Interactability_Text_Line_3 We had radio contact for a while, but couldnt locate each other. Last message I heard was 3 days ago, I fear the worst has happened for us all.
Interactability_Text_Line_4 A foul creature attacked me a day after that, and I have a deep, infected wound. Im holding on for dear life.
Interactability_Text_Line_5 Search this region of the mountains, for our intel indicates there must be something important here. Finish my mission, please. S.S. Delta, over and out.
