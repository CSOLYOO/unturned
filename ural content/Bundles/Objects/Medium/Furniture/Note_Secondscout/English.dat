Interactability_Text_Line_1 ---
Interactability_Text_Line_2 Got lost from rest of party in blizzard. Last message from Ceta: "Ive found it..." averting path north, heading south to Ceta to assist.
Interactability_Text_Line_3 Will camp in this cottage, its not safe but better than freezing to death or getting eaten by the things I can see creeping around in the bushes outside.
Interactability_Text_Line_4 Fell asleep, woke up to a giant spider attacking me, after a long struggle it ran away, but bit me several times, I am hurting all over.
Interactability_Text_Line_5 Someone must get to Ceta, whatever he found, I think it is the thing Eduard sent us here to locate. But my wounds are too heavy, S.S. Scout Beta signing off...
