Name Note - Mistress

Interactability_Text_Line_0 The Mistress of the Copper Mountain
Interactability_Text_Line_1 A young mining factory worker, "Stephan", meets a woman in unusual clothing. He realises that the woman is actually the legendary "Mistress of the Copper Mountain".
Interactability_Text_Line_2 She orders Stephan to tell his bailiff, the "Stinking Goat", to stop mining the ores from all the mines in the Ural Mountains.
Interactability_Text_Line_3 Stephan does as he is told and pays the price: he is flogged and sent to a deadly, collapsing mine pit. He is then saved by the Mistress herself.
Interactability_Text_Line_4 She brings Stephan to her domain, shows him her riches and proposes marriage. Stepan honestly replies that he already promised to marry another girl, Nastyona.
Interactability_Text_Line_5 The Mistress is both angered and delighted by his reply. She reveals that her proposal was a test of Stephan's honesty and integrity.
Interactability_Text_Line_6 She presents a malachite casket filled with jewellery for Nastyona and lets the man go, making one final request that Stephan would forget about her.
Interactability_Text_Line_7 Unfortunately, Stephan cannot do that. He marries Nastyona and lives with her for many years, but he is unhappy. One day he goes away and doesn't come back.
Interactability_Text_Line_8 His body is later found lying by a large rock near the domain of the Mistress. The tale concludes with the words:
Interactability_Text_Line_9 "It's a chancy thing to meet her [The Mistress], it brings woe for a bad man, and for a good one there's little joy comes of it". - Pavel Bazhov
